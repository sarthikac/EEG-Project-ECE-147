## EEG Motor Imagery Classification (EE C247 Project)
This project was developed as part of UCLAâ€™s EE C247: Neural Networks and Deep Learning course. The goal was to apply advanced neural network architectures to a real-world research problem using EEG data from motor imagery tasks.

## Project Summary
Objective: Classify EEG signals corresponding to 4 motor imagery tasks (left hand, right hand, both feet, tongue).
Dataset: BCI Competition IV, Dataset 2a
22 EEG channels
9 subjects
250 Hz sampling rate
