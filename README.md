EEG Motor Imagery Classification (EE C247 Project)
This project was developed as part of UCLA‚Äôs EE C247: Neural Networks and Deep Learning course. The goal was to apply advanced neural network architectures to a real-world research problem using EEG data from motor imagery tasks.

üß† Project Summary
Objective: Classify EEG signals corresponding to 4 motor imagery tasks (left hand, right hand, both feet, tongue).
Dataset: BCI Competition IV, Dataset 2a
22 EEG channels
9 subjects
250 Hz sampling rate

Challenge: EEG data is noisy and complex ‚Äî ideal for testing deep learning methods beyond CNNs.

‚öôÔ∏è What I Built:
Preprocessing pipeline for EEG trial segmentation and normalization
Baseline CNN model for classification
Implemented and tested post-CNN models (e.g., RNNs, Transformer-based networks)
Evaluated performance across subjects and visualized results

üìà Outcome:
Improved classification accuracy using advanced architectures
Gained experience with EEG data, deep learning model development, and subject generalization
Built a clean, modular pipeline for experimentation and reproducibility

üîß Tools Used:
Python, PyTorch
MNE for EEG processing
NumPy, Matplotlib
Jupyter for experimentation
